# vrog
A make-like build system in Python.

## Samples
The samples build a basic C project.
To build, simply run the sample's respective build.py.
The `basic` sample is not _simple_. Rather, it demonstrates the _basic_ `BuildSystem.add_rule`.
The `ctarget` sample demonstrates the `BuildSystem.add_ctarget`.
The targets of the sample build systems are `example.out`, `clean`, `main.o`, `a.o`, `b.o` and `c.o`.
